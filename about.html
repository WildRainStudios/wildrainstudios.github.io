<h1> WildRain is a Game/Film Studio. </h1>

<p> Our goal is to make the best games – games that are played by as many people as possible </p>
<p> We used this simple sentence to describe our idea of a new kind of games company that would put people front and center. We thought to ourselves: “What if you put together a games company the way you’d put together a professional sports team?” In that type of model, the sole mission of the founders and management would be to acquire the best talent for every single position, create the best possible environment for them, and then get out of the way. It would be an environment with zero bureaucracy. A place where the best people could make the biggest possible impact and nothing would stand in their way. Everything else, including financial goals, would be secondary. We realised that even more important than having the best people is having the best teams – just as in sports, where World Cups and Championships are won by teams, not individuals. </p>
